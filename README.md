# Discord-Bot
Experimenting with python to create a star wars themed discord bot. It is currently a work in progress, but by the time I am finished, my B1 battle droid bot will be able to respond to messages, greet new members to the discrod channel, remind members of upcomming events, and respond to commands.

### Functionalities (as of right now)
* Responds to certain messages
* Greets new users

### What I learned
* How to use the discord.py API
* How to create a discord bot
* Python basics
